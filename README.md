# JitterDiffusion

## Introduction

JittorDiffusion is a project **dedicated to transferring amazing diffusion model-based projects** from PyTorch to [**Jittor**](https://github.com/Jittor/jittor), **harnessing Jittor's high performance and unique advantages**.

At the core of Jittor is its JIT compiler, which converts Python code into **efficient CUDA instructions in real-time**, automatically optimizing computations for *speed and memory efficiency* based on input shapes and types. 

By leveraging these features, JittorDiffusion not only enhances performance but also provides flexibility and ease of use. Furthermore, these projects serve as exemplars for future high-quality Jittor projects, showcasing the framework's potential for research, education, and production environments.

## Installation

Our Work is based on:
- [jittor](https://github.com/JittorRepos/jittor)
- [jtorch](https://github.com/JittorRepos/jtorch)
- [diffusers_jittor](https://github.com/JittorRepos/diffusers_jittor)
- [transformers_jittor](https://github.com/JittorRepos/transformers_jittor)

### 0. Clone JDiffusion & Prepare Env
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JittorRepos/JDiffusion.git
#We recommend using conda to configure the Python environment.
conda create -n jdiffusion python=3.9
conda activate jdiffusion
```
### 1. Install Requirements

Our code is based on JTorch, a high-performance dynamically compiled deep learning framework fully compatible with the PyTorch interface, please install our version of library.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/JittorRepos/jittor
pip install git+https://github.com/JittorRepos/jtorch
pip install git+https://github.com/JittorRepos/diffusers_jittor
pip install git+https://github.com/JittorRepos/transformers_jittor
```
or just
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
### 2. Install JDiffusion

```bash
cd JDiffusion
pip install -e .
```
We also provide a [docker image](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/assets/docker/jdiffusion.tar) (md5:62c305028dae6e62d3dff885d5bc9294) about our environment.

### 3.Optional Requirements
 If you encounter `No module named 'cupy'`:
```bash
# Install CuPy from source
pip install cupy
# Install CuPy for cuda11.2 (Recommended, change cuda version you use)
pip install cupy-cuda112
```
### 4.Install Specific App

Follow the README in example folder to install the application you want!
